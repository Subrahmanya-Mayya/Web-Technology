      <h2>About Beluga</h2>
      <p>
        Beluga was born on March 4, 2002, in the United States to an American
        family. His zodiac sign is Pisces, and it is unknown what his real name
        is. Beluga has been posting videos to the network for a while, but he
        prefers to keep his face hidden in the background.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2017, Beluga established a channel on YouTube to launch his career.
        He had a separate YouTube account called “Explore Lucid Dreaming” where
        he started posting videos before beginning the “Beluga” channel on
        September 30, 2017. He provided lucid dreaming tutorials to his
        followers on the channel. Although he began that channel in September
        2017, his first video wasn’t released until January 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had accumulated roughly 650 subscribers in his first five months of
        video content. But he gained thousands of subscribers after his video,
        “13 Things You Should NEVER Do In Lucid Dreams!” went viral. By the end
        of that year, he had close to 500k subscribers.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s Mathematically Unlikely You Will Watch This” is the first video
        that was published on the Beluga channel. This video has over 3.9
        million views as of June 2022 and shows the probability of a viewer
        coming across the video and watching it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beluga mainly posts speedrun or Discord-related meme videos on his
        channel. Although this is supposedly his second channel, it has swiftly
        surpassed his Lucid Dreaming channel in popularity as a result of the
        nature of the content in late June 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beluga now posts videos related to Discord, some of which are partially
        canon or serial. The main character of these videos is typically Beluga
        himself; however, occasionally, he disguises himself as “Beluwuga,” an
        anime female, or “Beluga Jr.,” his son (who has a YouTube channel as
        well).
      </p>
      <h2>Net Worth</h2>
      <p>
        As of June 2022, Beluga’s net worth is $800,000 according to various
        sources. His major income source is YouTube. He uses his three YouTube
        channels to generate his income. According to SocialBlade, he earns
        $30.4k to $486.1k per month and $364.6k to $5.8 million per year.
